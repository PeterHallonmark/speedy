This is going to be a binary version of Arch Linux initscripts.

The code is developed to become a monolithic program but a main focus is to keep 
the code modularized.

Things that currently are on my TODO list:
------------------------------------------
* Read rc.conf (and others) with a script and generate config files which 
  contains information about for example locale settings, hostname, modules.

* Make it possible to lanch daemons that are not implemented in C. Pretty much
  generate code to run anything from /etc/rc.d/* 


Future improvements:
--------------------
* Multithreaded with dependency functionality

* Add init functionality so it can replace sysvinit 

* Add support for LVM and other stuff that I don't use.
